# Basic System Inventory
This is a prototype of an Inventory Management System.
I have used the Java programming language and the MVC architecture pattern.

Everything that is included in this project is what was reviewed throughout the semester of the Programming Language III degree in the Systems Engineering degree.

The inventory system has a login that can be used by an administrator or by users created through the administrator.

Within the administrator you can manage the users who will access the system, the products and the product categories.
On the user (employee) side, you can invoice the output of a product and create an invoice that is generated in PDF. and is saved in the resource folder to be downloaded later.

When creating the products, each product has a barcode that is then generated and can be scanned.
